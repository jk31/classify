# TODO
## Backend
* check required fields
* make other models available
* make more evaluations like false negatives? maybe a graphic?
* download example dataset
    * clean heart or churn datasets with better column names
* demo
    * make new view for demo that does not require login

## Frontend
* landing page
* form styling
    * for model success make a container with a background like a jumbotron
* instructions for dataset requirements
* remove not needed crispy tags
* make scrollbar always visible because it shakes when activated with show columns? or is there a way to account for it in the base layout

## DevOps
* find domain
* remove staticfiles
* check heroku stuff
    * how to save files?
